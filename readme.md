# About Shinden Client 4
![Tauri logo](https://tauri.app/img/index/header_dark.svg)
- The project is currently being rewritten in Tauri (Rust + SvelteKit) under the name Shinden Client 4.
- Shinden Client 3.1 created in Electron will lose support as of the release of version 4. However, it is possible that it will receive some updates.
- We are writing the new version in a way that allows the project to be easily extended with new anime sites. Replacing Electron with Tauri brings many benefits including a faster backend.

Progress can be tracked in the [rust-rewrite branch](https://github.com/KlapChat-Entertainment/shinden-client/tree/rust-rewrite).

# shinden-client-electron
